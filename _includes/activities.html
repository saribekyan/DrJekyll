    <p>
    I am a teaching assistant for <a href="https://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/6/sp17/6.816">6.816/6.836 Multicore Programming course</a> at MIT.

    <p>
    I have participated in two <a href="http://misti.mit.edu/global-teaching-labs">Global Teaching Labs programs</a>: in Italy and in Armenia.
    Members of MIT Armenian Society, including myself, have played an active role in <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2015/misti-global-teaching-labs-launches-armenia-pilot-program-1123">initiating the program in 2015</a>.
    So far we have successfully, completed two GTL Armenia Programs.

    My brother and I work work on making short educational videos for school students that teach how to use computation in a variety of problems, such as modelling planet movement.
    See the <a href="https://cs4hs-am.github.io">website</a> (in Armenian).

    Prior to MIT, I have trained the Armenian national team for International Olympiad in Informatics and was the deputy leader of the team in IOI 2011 in Thailand.
